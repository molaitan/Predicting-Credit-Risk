# Predicting-Credit-Risk
HW 19 -Supervised Machine Learning 


For this assignment, built a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a load from LendingClub will be high risk or not. 
2 models were created and compared: logistic regression and random forests classifier. Predictions were made on wich model would perform better. The the data was retrieved, cleanred, trained, and tested on unscaled and then scaled data.
